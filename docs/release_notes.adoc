[[rn_1.6.0_upgrade_notes]]
== Upgrade Notes

* Upgrading directly from Kudu 1.5.0 is supported and no special upgrade steps
  are required. A rolling upgrade may work, however it has not been tested.
  When upgrading Kudu, it is recommended to first shut down all Kudu processes
  across the cluster, then upgrade the software on all servers, then restart
  the Kudu processes on all servers in the cluster.

[[rn_1.6.0_obsoletions]]
== Obsoletions

* Support for Spark 1 (kudu-spark_2.10) has been **removed** in Kudu 1.6.0 and
  now only Spark 2 is supported. Spark 1 support was deprecated in Kudu 1.5.0.

[[rn_1.6.0_deprecations]]
== Deprecations

* Support for Java 7 has been deprecated since Kudu 1.5.0 and may be removed in
  the next major release.

[[rn_1.6.0_new_features]]
== New features

* Tablet servers' tolerance of disk failures is now enabled by default and has
  been extended to handle data directory failures at runtime. In the event of
  a disk failure at runtime, any tablets with data on a failed disk will be
  shut down and restarted on another tablet server. There is a configurable
  tradeoff between a newly added tablet's tolerance to disk failures and its
  ability to parallelize reads via the experimental
  `--fs_target_data_dirs_per_tablet` flag. Tablets that are spread across fewer
  disks are less likely to be affected by a disk failure, at the cost of
  reduced parallelism. By default, tablets are striped across all available
  disks. Note that the first configured data directory and the WAL directory
  cannot currently tolerate disk failures. This will be further improved in
  future Kudu releases.

* Kudu servers can now adopt new data directories via the new
  `kudu fs update_dirs` tool. The new directory will be used by new tablet
  replicas only. Note that removing directories is not yet supported
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2202[KUDU-2202]).

* Kudu servers have two new flags to control webui TLS/HTTPS
  settings: `--webserver_tls_ciphers` and `--webserver_tls_min_protocol`.
  These flags allow the advertised TLS ciphers and TLS protocol versions to be
  configured. Additionally, the webserver now excludes insecure legacy ciphers
  by default
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2190[KUDU-2190]).

== Optimizations and improvements

* Kudu servers can now tolerate short interruptions in NTP clock
  synchronization. NTP synchronization is still required when any Kudu daemon
  starts up. If NTP synchronization is not available, diagnostic information
  is now logged to help pinpoint the issue
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1578[KUDU-1578]).

* Tablet server startup time has been improved significantly on servers
  containing large numbers of blocks.

* The log block manager now performs disk data deletion in batches. This
  optimization can significantly reduce the time taken to delete data on a tablet.

* The usage of sensitive data redaction flag has been slightly changed. By
  setting `--redact=log` flag, redaction will be disabled in the web UI but
  retained for server logs. Alternatively, `--redact=none` can be used to
  disable redaction completely.

* The Spark DataSource integration now can take advantage of scan locality
  for better scan performance, the scan will take place at the closest replica
  instead of going to the leader.

* Various optimizations were made to reduce the 99th percentile latency of
  writes on the tablet server. This can also improve throughput on certain
  write workloads, particularly on larger clusters.

* Kudu may now be configured to ignore system-wide auth_to_local mappings
  configured in /etc/krb5.conf by setting the configuration flag
  `--use_system_auth_to_local=false`
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2198[KUDU-2198]).

* The performance of the compaction scheduler has been improved. In
  previous versions, certain types of time series workloads were found to
  cause compaction scheduling to take tens of seconds. These workloads now
  schedule compactions an order of magnitude more efficiently.

* The compaction scheduler has been improved to avoid running a compaction
  when the benefit of that compaction is extremely small.

* Tablet servers now consider the health of all replicas of a tablet before
  deciding to evict one. This can improve stability of the Kudu cluster after
  experiencing multiple simultaneous daemon failures
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2048[KUDU-2048]).

* Several performance improvements have been made to the Kudu master,
  particularly in concurrency of clients opening tables. This should improve
  performance in highly concurrent workloads.

* The on-disk size metric for a tablet now includes all data and metadata.
  Previously, it excluded WAL segments and consensus metadata
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1755[KUDU-1755]).

* Added verbose mode for the 'kudu cluster ksck' command to enable output
  of detailed information on the cluster's metadata, even when no errors are
  detected.

[[rn_1.6.0_fixed_issues]]
== Fixed Issues

* HybridTime timestamp propagation now works in the Java client when using scan
  tokens (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1411[KUDU-1411]).

* Fixed an error message commonly found in tablet server logs indicating that
  operations were being read "from the future"
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1078[KUDU-1078]).

* Tombstoned tablets no longer report metrics
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2044[KUDU-2044]).

* Fixed a bug in the C++ client which could cause tablets to be erroneously
  pruned, or skipped, during certain scans, resulting in fewer results than
  expected being returned from queries. The bug only affected tables whose range
  partition columns are a proper prefix of the primary key
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2173[KUDU-2173]).

* KUDU-2312: The evaluation order of predicates in scans with multiple
  predicates has been made deterministic. Due to a bug, this was not necessarily
  the case previously. Predicates are applied in most to least selective order,
  with ties broken by column index. The evaluation order may change in the
  future, particularly when better column statistics are made available
  internally.

* Published Kudu Java artifacts are now fully compatible with JRE 7 and JRE 8.
  There was previously a bug in the release process which made them compatible
  only with JRE 8
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2188[KUDU-2188]).

* Fixed a typo in the list of default TLS ciphers used by Kudu servers. As a
  result, two additional cipher suites are now available:
** ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256 TLSv1.2 Kx=ECDH Au=RSA Enc=AES(128)  Mac=SHA256
** AES256-GCM-SHA384       TLSv1.2 Kx=RSA  Au=RSA Enc=AESGCM(256) Mac=AEAD

[[rn_1.6.0_wire_compatibility]]
== Wire Protocol compatibility

Kudu 1.6.0 is wire-compatible with previous versions of Kudu:

* Kudu 1.6 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.0 or later. If the client uses
  features that are not available on the target server, an error will be returned.
* Rolling upgrade between Kudu 1.5 and Kudu 1.6 servers is believed to be possible
  though has not been sufficiently tested. Users are encouraged to shut down all nodes
  in the cluster, upgrade the software, and then restart the daemons on the new version.
* Kudu 1.0 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.6 with the exception of the
  below-mentioned restrictions regarding secure clusters.

The authentication features introduced in Kudu 1.3 place the following limitations
on wire compatibility between Kudu 1.6 and versions earlier than 1.3:

* If a Kudu 1.6 cluster is configured with authentication or encryption set to "required",
  clients older than Kudu 1.3 will be unable to connect.
* If a Kudu 1.6 cluster is configured with authentication and encryption set to "optional"
  or "disabled", older clients will still be able to connect.

[[rn_1.6.0_incompatible_changes]]
== Incompatible Changes in Kudu 1.6.0

[[rn_1.6.0_client_compatibility]]
=== Client Library Compatibility

* The Kudu 1.6 Java client library is API- and ABI-compatible with Kudu 1.5. Applications
  written against Kudu 1.5 will compile and run against the Kudu 1.6 client library and
  vice-versa.

* The Kudu 1.6 {cpp} client is API- and ABI-forward-compatible with Kudu 1.5.
  Applications written and compiled against the Kudu 1.5 client library will run without
  modification against the Kudu 1.6 client library. Applications written and compiled
  against the Kudu 1.6 client library will run without modification against the Kudu 1.5
  client library.

* The Kudu 1.6 Python client is API-compatible with Kudu 1.5. Applications
  written against Kudu 1.5 will continue to run against the Kudu 1.6 client
  and vice-versa.
